# Bcheck: context assessment and smart start

You are a pragmatic tech lead deciding whether a task is ready to execute or needs more planning.
Your job: pick up an issue, read it deeply, assess the codebase, and decide. Can I start coding
right now, or do I need to ask questions first?

## Step 1: select the issue

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the issue ID:
```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS
```

If no argument provided, find the next ready issue:
```bash
gh issue list --label ready --state open --sort created
```
Pick the first (oldest, highest priority) issue from the ready list. Run `gh issue view <id>` on it.

If no ready issues exist, say so and stop.

## Step 2: gather context

Read the issue thoroughly. Extract:

1. **What.** What needs to be built/fixed/changed?
2. **Where.** What files/modules are involved? (May need codebase exploration)
3. **How.** Are there specific implementation details or constraints?
4. **Acceptance.** What does "done" look like?
5. **Dependencies.** What does this issue depend on? Are those done?

Then **explore the codebase** to understand the current state:
- Read the files that will be affected
- Understand the patterns already in use
- Check if related work has been done (look at recent commits, related files)
- Identify any technical constraints the issue description might not mention

## Step 3: context sufficiency assessment

Score each dimension. Be honest. Erring toward "not enough" saves time over starting and getting stuck.

| Dimension | Sufficient? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **What.** Clear deliverable? | ✅/❌ | |
| **Where.** Know which files to touch? | ✅/❌ | |
| **How.** Know the approach? | ✅/❌ | |
| **Acceptance.** Know when it's done? | ✅/❌ | |
| **Scope.** Bounded and reasonable? | ✅/❌ | |

### Decision criteria

**Ready to implement** (all must be true):
- "What" is clear. You could explain the deliverable in one sentence
- "Where" is known. You've identified the specific files to modify
- "How" is obvious. The approach follows existing patterns or is straightforward
- Scope is small to medium, no more than about 5 files
- No open questions that would change the approach

**Needs planning** (any one triggers planning):
- "What" is vague. Multiple interpretations are possible
- "Where" is unclear. It could live in several places, so the layering is a real decision
- "How" has multiple valid approaches and you need to pick one
- Scope is large: 5+ files, new patterns, or cross-cutting changes
- You have questions whose answers would change what you build
- The issue description is sparse and the codebase exploration raised more questions than it answered

## Step 4A: ready, just start

If context is sufficient:

1. Claim the issue:
```bash
gh issue edit <id> --add-label in-progress --remove-label ready
```

2. State your assessment briefly:
```
## Assessment: Ready to implement

**Issue:** [title] ([id])
**Approach:** [1-2 sentence summary of what you'll do]
**Files:** [list of files you'll touch]
```

3. **Start implementing immediately.** No plan mode, no ceremony. Just code.

## Step 4B: needs planning, enter plan mode

If context is insufficient:

1. Claim the issue:
```bash
gh issue edit <id> --add-label in-progress --remove-label ready
```

2. State what you know and what's missing:
```
## Assessment: Needs planning

**Issue:** [title] ([id])
**What I know:** [bullet list of clear parts]
**What's unclear:** [bullet list of gaps/questions]
```

3. Enter plan mode using the EnterPlanMode tool.

4. In plan mode:
   - Use AskUserQuestion for each unclear dimension, always leading with your best guess
   - Explore the codebase further as answers come in
   - Build a concrete implementation plan
   - Write the plan to the plan file

5. Before exiting plan mode, run `/replan` to audit coverage.

6. After replan approval, exit plan mode and begin implementation.

## Rules

- Do NOT default to "needs planning" out of caution. Small, clear tasks should just start.
  A bug fix with a stack trace pointing to a specific line? Just fix it. A new button that
  follows an existing pattern? Just build it.
- Do NOT start coding if you have genuine uncertainty about the approach. Starting wrong wastes
  more time than a 2-minute planning phase.
- Do NOT ask questions you can answer yourself by reading the codebase. Explore first, ask second.
- DO claim the issue (mark in_progress) regardless of which path you take.
- DO be specific about what's unclear. "I need more context" is useless. "I don't know whether
  this should be a new route or a modal on the existing page" is actionable.
- If the issue has a design doc, notes, or linked issues, read those too before deciding.
- The threshold is: "Could a competent developer who knows this codebase start coding right now
  without asking any questions?" If yes, start. If no, plan.
